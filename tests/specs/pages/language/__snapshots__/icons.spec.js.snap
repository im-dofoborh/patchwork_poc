      <h2>Using icons</h2>
      <p>
        Icons are supplied in SVG format and accessed as a background image
        on an element decorated with the class name for the required icon.
        For example, to apply the arrow icon you would use
        <code>
          &lt;i class="icon-arrow" /&gt;
        </code>
        As the size of an icon will
        vary depending on the component it is within, it does not get given a
        size by default. Typically you would want to include the icon as part
        of your BEM block
        <code>
          &lt;i class="bem-block__icon icon-arrow" /&gt;
        </code>
        to allow you to
        apply sizing and positioning to your icon within the component.
      </p>
      <p>
        To apply CSS, including animations, to an icon you may optionally add
        the attribute <code>data-grunticon-embed</code> to the icon element.
        For example,
        <code>
          &lt;i class="icon-arrow" data-grunticon-embed /&gt;
        </code>.
        On page load,
        the SVG markup will be injected inside this element, allowing you to
        target elements within the SVG for styling.
      </p>
